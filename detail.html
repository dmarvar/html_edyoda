      <h3>Travel to France</h3>
      <p>
        France, officially the French Republic , is a country whose territory
        consists of metropolitan France in Western Europe and several overseas
        regions and territories.[XIII] The metropolitan area of France extends
        from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and
        from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. It is bordered by Belgium,
        Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast, Switzerland and Italy to the
        east, and Andorra and Spain to the south. The overseas territories
        include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the
        Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. The country's 18 integral regions
        (five of which are situated overseas) span a combined area of 643,801
        square kilometres (248,573 sq mi) and a total population of 67.02
        million (as of July 2019).[10] France is a unitary semi-presidential
        republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main
        cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban areas include Lyon,
        Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Lille and Nice. <br /><br />
        During the Iron Age, what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by
        the Gauls, a Celtic people. Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, holding it
        until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476, who formed the Kingdom of
        Francia. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East
        Francia, Middle Francia and West Francia. West Francia, which became the
        Kingdom of France in 987, emerged as a major European power in the Late
        Middle Ages, following its victory in the Hundred Years' War
        (1337â€“1453). During the Renaissance, French culture flourished and a
        global colonial empire was established, which by the 20th century would
        become the second largest in the world.[11] The 16th century was
        dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Protestants
        (Huguenots). France became Europe's dominant cultural, political, and
        military power in the 17th century under Louis XIV.[12] In the late 18th
        century, the French Revolution overthrew the absolute monarchy,
        establishing one of modern history's earliest republics and drafting the
        Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which expresses the
        nation's ideals to this day.
